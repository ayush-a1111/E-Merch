# Ecommerce website
Developed this keeping in mind the new small scale businesses tat were growing in corona period , So the main idea is to ease the work of admins so that these small scale industries can have their own website in which they can add, delete or rename products with ease rather than listing their products on popular ecommerce website , they can have their own website.

Developed an E-commerce website from scratch using MERN Stack.

Implemented a feature called admin dashboard which is exclusive for admin and useful in adding, deleting and renaming
products and categories.

Implemented authentication and authorization for users.

Implemented CRUD operations on user profile, products and categories.

Tech used : ReactJs for Frontend ; NodeJs and ExpressJs for Backend ; MongoDB as Database
